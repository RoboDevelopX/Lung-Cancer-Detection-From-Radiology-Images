## Lung Cancer Detection using CNNs


### ðŸ§  Overview of Project: <br>
Neural network plays a key role in the recognion of the cancer cells among the normal ssues. It provides an effecve tool for building an assisve AI based cancer detecon. This project presents a CNN-based technique to classify lung tumours as malignant or benign.
<br>
Identification of skin diseases is done using image analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks. It is found that by using the Convolutional neural networks we can achieve a higher accuracy rate.
